problem: [
  "I need to retain more Millennial workers. I spend a lot of money training
    them but they typically leave the company after 6-8 months.",
  "My teammates frequently do not read or respond to email messages completely
    and questions need to be posed repeatedly.",
  "My marketing department is silo'd off from my product department. What can I do?"
]
adaptability: [
  "To retain more Millennial workers I could adapt some company policies to their
    interests and work styles - e.g. take on a pro bono social change cause;
    allow them to work from home one day per week, etc.",
  "To increase accountability with my teammates I could adopt a cloud tool such as
    Slack to track threaded conversations that are unwieldy in email.",
  "To remove the silo mentality in my company I could challenge the department
    heads to define a unified vision that all departments will follow."
]
cultural_competence: [
  "To retain more Millennial workers I could create a Young Leaders program to
    solicit project proposals from a different group each month and build a culture
    of inclusion with them.",
  "To increase accountability with my teammates I could conduct a team alignment
    exercise where we agree on email norms such as clear subject lines, state your
    request in the first sentence, etc.",
  "To remove the silo mentality in my company I could implement a monthly collaboration
    metric akin to our existing monthly growth metric."
]
empathy: [
  "To retain more Millennial workers I could conduct formal interviews with our
    Millennials to better understand why they behave the way they do.",
  "To increase accountability with my teammates I could listen to their concerns
    in a group discussion and vote on a list of actions we can take to collectively do better.",
  "To remove the silo mentality in my company I could have workers write out suggestions
    for interdepartmental projects that would save the company money and take those
    suggestions to senior management."
]
intellectual_curiosity: [
  "To retain more Millennial workers I could read the top three books on Amazon about
    managing Millennials and send a package of pertinent excerpts to my exec team.",
  "To increase accountability with my teammates I could interview a handful of
    productivity consultants about our company's issue and hire one in the next quarter.",
  "To remove the silo mentality in my company I could set savings targets for
    collaboration projects and give VPs bonuses based on hitting targets."
]
thinking: [
  "To retain more Millennial workers I could implement a quarterly training program
    with Millennial friendly courses. Also implement a step by step job progression
    tree that allows Millennials to see feel like they are moving up steadily.",
  "To increase accountability with my teammates I could implement an Team Email
    Agreement and check in with all members monthly regarding adherence.",
  "To remove the silo mentality in my company I could set savings targets and hold
    quarterly inter-departmental problem solving sessions to clear rock blocks in real time."
