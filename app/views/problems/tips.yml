problem:
  intro_text: "State a COMMUNICATION CHALLENGE you would like to overcome. Keep
    this to ~200 characters. Try to complete in less than 3 minutes."
  examples: [
    "I need to retain more Millennial workers. I spend a lot of money training
      them but they typically leave the company after 6-8 months.",
    "My teammates frequently do not read or respond to email messages completely
      and questions need to be posed repeatedly.",
    "My marketing department is silo'd off from my product department. What can I do?"
  ]
adaptability:
  intro_text: "Be agile and flexible to respond to new risks and opportunities.

  examples: [
    "To retain more Millennial workers I could adapt some company policies to their
      interests and work styles - e.g. take on a pro bono social change cause;
      allow them to work from home one day per week, etc.",
    "To increase accountability with my teammates I could adopt a cloud tool such as
      Slack to track threaded conversations that are unwieldy in email.",

      heads to define a unified vision that all departments will follow."

cultural_competence:
  intro_text: "Learn the culture and language of others so you can think,
    move and act across cultural boundaries to achieve your goals. Examine how
    your approach will play in other work cultures - e.g. engineering dept culture
    vs sales dept culture. Remember to think beyond the culture of your own
    organizational unit. Don’t be limited by social and geographic boundaries
    whether interacting with diverse groups."

      metric akin to our existing monthly growth metric."

empathy:
  intro_text: "Put yourself in others’ shoes. Think about the Communication
    Challenge from their perspective. Imagine their needs, fears, and what they
    would say. Explore how others' points of view differ from your own and how
    those differences can provide new viewpoints and insights."
  examples: [
    "To retain more Millennial workers I could conduct formal interviews with our
      Millennials to better understand why they behave the way they do.",
    "To increase accountability with my teammates I could listen to their concerns
      in a group discussion and vote on a list of actions we can take to collectively do better.",
    "To remove the silo mentality in my company I could have workers write out suggestions
      for interdepartmental projects that would save the company money and take those
      suggestions to senior management."

intellectual_curiosity:
  intro_text: "Open your mind. Consider a variety of information sources - including
    unconventional sources. Think about your problem from different angles.
    Ask yourself what the opposite of a solution would be. Then apply critical

    "To retain more Millennial workers I could read the top three books on Amazon about
      managing Millennials and send a package of pertinent excerpts to my exec team.",
    "To increase accountability with my teammates I could interview a handful of
      productivity consultants about our company's issue and hire one in the next quarter.",

      collaboration projects and give VPs bonuses based on hitting targets."
  ]
thinking:
  intro_text: "Write a solution to your Communication Challenge that is informed

    Competence, Empathy and Intellectual Curiosity. Are there themes or patterns?
    Do they combine to spark new ideas?"
  examples: [
    "To retain more Millennial workers I could implement a quarterly training program
      with Millennial friendly courses. Also implement a step by step job progression
      tree that allows Millennials to see feel like they are moving up steadily.",
    "To increase accountability with my teammates I could implement an Team Email
      Agreement and check in with all members monthly regarding adherence.",
    "To remove the silo mentality in my company I could set savings targets and hold
      quarterly inter-departmental problem solving sessions to clear rock blocks in real time."
